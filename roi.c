-- About

ROI is a simple byte format for storing lossless images. There are a handful
of ways it does this, at its core each pixel is diffed from the previous
pixel and stored in up to a 4 byte encoding for RGB or up to a 6 byte encoding
for RGBA.

The format has 6 ops defined:
* QOI_OP_LUMA232, QOI_OP_LUMA464, QOI_OP_LUMA777, QOI_OP_RGB: RGB ops, encode in
  1/2/3/4 bytes respectively
* QOI_OP_RUN: 1 byte RLE repeating the previous pixel 1..30 times
* QOI_OP_RGBA: 2 byte encoding used whenever alpha changes, followed by an RGB
  op to encode the RGB elements

In detail:

vr, vg, vb are red green blue diffed from the previous pixel respectively

vg_r, vg_b are vr and vb respectively diffed from vg

LUMA op values are stored with a bias, for example a 3 bit value is in the range
-4..3 inclusive, which is stored as 0..7 by adding 4

QOI_OP_RUN: xxxxx111
	1 byte op defining a run of repeating pixels, x=0..29 indicates runs of 1..30
	respectively. x=30 and x=31 is reserved for use by QOI_OP_RGB and QOI_OP_RGBA

QOI_OP_LUMA232: bbrrggg0
  1 byte op that stores vg_r and vg_b in 2 bits, vg in 3 bits

QOI_OP_LUMA464: gggggg01 bbbbrrrr
  2 byte op that stores vg_r and vg_b in 4 bits, vg in 6 bits

QOI_OP_LUMA777: ggggg011 rrrrrrgg bbbbbbbr
  3 byte op that stores vg_r, vg_b and vg in 7 bits

QOI_OP_RGB: 11110111 gggggggg rrrrrrrr bbbbbbbb
  4 byte op that stores vg_r, vg_b and vg in 8 bits, without any bias

QOI_OP_RGBA: 11111111 aaaaaaaa
	2 byte op that stores the current alpha value. Always followed by an RGB op
	to fully define a pixel

The byte stream's end is marked with 7 0x00 bytes followed a single 0x01 byte.

Unlike most qoi-like formats roi stores values within ops in little endian.
This allows for optimisations on little-endian hardware, most hardware.
